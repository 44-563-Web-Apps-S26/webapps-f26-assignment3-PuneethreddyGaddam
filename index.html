    <h2>My Favorite Music Composer: Hans Zimmer</h2>
    <p>
      I like him because his music sounds very strong and emotional, especially in movies. 
      His music makes scenes feel more serious and exciting, even without people talking.
      I also like how his music creates suspense and keeps me interested. 
      Sometimes I listen to his music while studying because it helps me focus.
